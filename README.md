# D3D-Lite-Engine  
During my Game Development course at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Belgium, we were tasked with making our own basic 2D engine in our programming 4 class.  
This inspired me to make my own basic 3D engine. In class we learned about DirectX and we made our own software rasterizer, this made me look more into graphics programming and graphics API's.  
After some research, i decided to use the Vulkan API to render.  
For my graphics programming 2 course, i made a rntime model loader as a project.  

The renderer in itself can be found on my github as well:
