# D3D-Lite-Engine  
During my Game Development course at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Belgium, we were tasked with making our own basic 2D engine in our Programming 4 class.  
This inspired me to make my own basic 3D engine.  
In my Graphics Programming class, we learned about DirectX and we made our own software rasterizer, this made me look more into graphics programming and graphics API's.  
After some research, i decided to use the Vulkan API to render.  

For my graphics programming 2 course, we used Vulkan in class, a first time for our school. We were task to make a project to showcase our knowlegde.  
As the choice of project was very free, it took me a while to choose and concidering the amount of time we got for this assignment, i chose to make a runtime model and material loader.

As I was new to vulkan I started by creating a separate renderer that turned into a testing project, which can also be found on my github:
