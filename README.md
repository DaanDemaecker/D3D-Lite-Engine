# D3D-Lite-Engine  
During my Game Development course at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Belgium, we were tasked with making our own basic 2D engine in our programming 4 class.  
This inspired me to make my own basic 3D engine that uses the Vulkan API to render.  

The renderer in itself can be found on my github as well:
